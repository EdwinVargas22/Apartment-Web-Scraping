## Summary
This is a project where I used BeautifulSoup and requests to get the Top 250 TV Shows information from the IMDb website. It was a bit difficult because I had to figure out what I need to do so I could pull the rank, title of the tv show, release year, and IMDb rating for the 250 tv shows. At the end I was successfully able to pull all of the information I needed and save it to an excel file.
